Analysis of twitter data shows that the sentiment of current Government ministers' tweets over the pandemic are consistently more positive than their shadow counterparts with only a fraction of their tweets being negative. This is not wholly surprising - Government ministers want to make it seem as though they are doing an excellent job and over the course of the pandemic have tried to offer reassurance to the public. The shadow ministers on the other hand try to do almost the opposite - they want to convince the public that the Government is doing a terrible job and that they would do a much better job if they were voted for in the next election.

Looking at the breakdown of sentiment by department shows that the sentiment gap between the Tories and Labour varies. Keir Starmer (Leader of the Labour Party) is the most positive out of the Shadow cabinet analysed. Perhaps this is because he is also trying to reassure his party that he is doing a good job as leader, but this may be reading to much into it. Matt Hancock (the Health Secretary) is the most positive Tory minister, which seems rather strange given his role during the pandemic, but this is probably largely because of the constant praise he gives the NHS and perhaps shows his refusal to admit the horror that the pandemic has been. Priti Patel (Home Secretary) on the other hand is most negative Tory minister and there is little difference between her and the shadow minister. This probably shows that her tweets are reflective of her role, with constant reporting of crime and police activity.

Perhaps this says more about Labour’s twitter followers than it does
about the effectiveness of negativity for the Labour party’s popularity.
