Analysis of twitter data shows that the sentiment of the current Government minister's tweets over the pandemic are consistently more positive than their shadow counterparts and only a small fraction of their tweets are negative. This is not wholly surprising - Government ministers want to make it seem as though they are doing an excellent job and also over the course of the pandemic would have wanted to reassure the public. The shadow minister's on the other hand try to do almost the opposite - they want to convince the public that the Government is doing a terrible job and that they would do a much better job if they were voted for in the next election.

Perhaps this says more about Labour’s twitter followers than it does
about the effectiveness of negativity for the Labour party’s popularity.
