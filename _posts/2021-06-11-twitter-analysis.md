Boris Johnson is consitently more positive than Keir Starmer. But this
is really to be expected. In some ways Boris Johnson uses twitter in a
different manner to Keir Starmer. Boris generally uses it in the context
of his position in the Government, reporting the actions of his
Government and painting those actions in a positive light. Keir Starmer
on the other hand is spending his time trying to convince people that
the Government is doing a bad job at running a country and that people
should vote Labour in the next election.

Perhaps this says more about Labour’s twitter followers than it does
about the effectiveness of negativity for the Labour party’s popularity.
