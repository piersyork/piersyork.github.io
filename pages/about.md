I am studying for a Masterâ€™s degree in Public Policy at UCL, I have a particular interest in the role of government and the right to a private life. I am a graduate of Philosophy from the University of Leeds, where I specialised in ethics, political philosophy and the philosophy of science. My dissertation was on the ethics of torture and terrorism, focusing on whether a self-defence argument could be made to justify the use of torture. My current research is on the relationship between trust and pandemic policy.
